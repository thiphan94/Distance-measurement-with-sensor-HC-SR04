# Distance-measurement-with-sensor-HC-SR04

This is my project in the third year of my bachelor's in University Paris 8, I use EasyPIC v7 v7 with and code with Mikro C for measuring the distance with the sensor HCSR04 and display value in 7 segments. After that, I use PHP and SQLite to display the value of distance with the graph by JpGraph.
